# Machine Learning @ GDSC VIT-B(2023-2024)
---
Greetings! This is an Open Source Repository by the GDSC VIT-B's ML Team for the tenure 2023-2024. This repository consists of multiple ML and DL projects to learn from. We are always open to contributions and innovative ideas!</br>

### PROJECTS ON SHOWCASE:
---
Here's a list of the showcased projects in this repo:

### AI Voice Assistant

> This project walks you through building your own AI Voice Assistant!

### Handwritten Digit Classification

> Built using the MNIST Dataset, this project explores both ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approaches to recognize handwritten digits. <br>
> This is a beginner level project to learn Deep Learning.<br>
> Inspired from [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview) , CNN performed better and Results 
> can be seen below:

### Electric Vehicle Classification

> TA model on classifying Electrics Vehicles on Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility, based on the kaggle dataset Electric Vehicle Population data.<br>
> We used XGBClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, Logistic Regression and DecisionTreeClassifier.<br>

### Titanic Survival Prediction

> One of the most beginner friendly and usually the first of many, this project predicts the Survivability of Passengers aboard the Titanic.<br>
> Based on the Kaggle Dataset on Titanic.<br>
> We used RandomForestClassifier to achieve an accuracy of 80.6%, with an AUC of 78.7%.<br>

### Heart Disease Prediction

> This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health indicators and medical data. <br>
> The prediction model analyzes the input features and provide a probability or classification indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.<br>
> The Model is built using Machine Learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.<br>

### Spam Mail Classification

> This project focuses on developing a spam mail detection system using machine learning algorithms.<br>
> The goal is to classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam based on their content and characteristics.<br>
> By automatically filtering out spam emails, this system can improve email communication efficiency and security.<br>
> The spam mail detection model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression.<br>
> The model learns to distinguish between spam and ham emails based on the textual content and other features.<br>

### Book Recommender System

> This project implements a book recommendation system based on user ratings data.<br>
> The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend books to users based on their preferences and behavior.<br>
> Users who have rated more than 200 books and books with at least 50 ratings are selected to build the recommendation model.<br>
> A pivot table is created where each row represents a book and each column represents a user, with ratings as the values.<br>
> Cosine similarity is computed between books based on user ratings, resulting in a similarity matrix.<br>
> A function is implemented to recommend similar books to a given book.<br>
> It takes the book title as input and returns a list of recommended books based on similarity scores.<br>

---
### Twitter Sentiment Analysis

> This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques.<br>
> The sentiment analysis task involves predicting the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets.<br>
> The Data is first preprocessed to our requirements by Vectorization and implementing other Basic NLP Preprocessing Techniques.<br>
> We then use a Bag of Words approach for our processing to be complete.<br>
> We train a Logistic Regression Model for the Sentiment Analysis.<br>
